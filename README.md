# Buck plugin for IntelliJ

### Facebook 2015 Summer Intern Hackathon Project

Buck build system (http://buckbuild.com/) is widely used as a fast build tool especially for Android development. Unfortunately IntelliJ still has no plugin for it, therefore we plan to hack a Buck plugin for all JetBrains IDEs and raise our working efficiency.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting for BUCK file
* Keywords auto completion
* Go to buck file with one click
* Go to to paths of dependencies with one click
* Shortcuts for buck commands, e.g. buck install/build/test (still under development)

## Feedbacks

All bug reporting and other feedbacks are super welcome!
Just post something here: https://github.com/wangyanxing/buck_idea_plugin/issues
