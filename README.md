# Buck plugin for IntelliJ

### Facebook 2015 Summer Intern Hackathon Project

Buck build system (http://buckbuild.com/) is widely used as a fast build tool especially for Android development. Unfortunately IntelliJ still has no plugin for it, therefore we plan to hack a Buck plugin for all JetBrains IDEs and raise our working efficiency.
